Problem solving. Creativity. Opportunity. I've always worked in analytical type jobs in the biotech field, but I realize that I love having creative outlets in planning new experiments that have never been done before. This combination opens a plethora of doors for future endeavors and in a practical sense, I'd have the freedom to work in a vast array of fields. For these reasons, I chose to pursue software engineering.
